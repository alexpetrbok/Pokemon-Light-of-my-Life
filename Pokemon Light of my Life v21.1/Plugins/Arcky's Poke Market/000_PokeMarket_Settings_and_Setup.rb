# If it would be easier to setup stores here then you only need to add an event script line saying pbStore1 or whatever you called the method.
# Since you're more limited in space in the event, it could be easier to manage your stores here (or you can make .rb files for each store)

# the arguments are as following pbPokemonMart(["refresh type", [:ITEM, min, max], :ITEM], "SellerClass", true, false)
# "refresh type" = this can either be "random", "daily", "2daily" or "weekly" or if you don't want limited stock just don't include this at all.
# [:ITEM, min, max] = an array containing the item and a min and max amount
# (the min and max values will be used to generate a random amount between these number which will decide the limited amount of stock for this item)
# :ITEM = just the item and no item limit is given (this item won't run out of stock)
# "SellerClass" like the examples above ProSeller or BerrySeller these are classes, this is required if you want to use custom speeches for your saleman.
# true = item categories are enabled (items will be devided in categories which might look more orginized).
# false = can't sell is disabled or just don't put this at all (true is enabled)
