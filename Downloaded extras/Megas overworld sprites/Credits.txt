hello, thanks for downloading the Mega & Gmax OW pack, I spent at least 2 to 3 hours resizing all the sprites. 
they are separated into 2 folders for easy access
inside each folder there are the ones that wouldn't work as Follower if you try to use them for that
since you can't have 2 files with the same name
put in the "Graphics/Characters" only the one you want to make an OW Encounter (whether Shiny or not)

Mega and Primal Evos Sprites:
- Kidkatt
- Larryturbo
- Princess-Phoenix

Gigantamax Form Sprites:
- SageDeoxys
- Lasse00

Indigo Disk & Teal Mask sprites:

- DarkusShadow, with help of:
EduarPokeN
