Overview
This script adds to the game an egg hatcher which allows the player to take alongside him up to 6 eggs without taking spaces from your team.
Once available to the player it will ask if they want to send newly obtained eggs directly to the hatcher.
It is fully plug and play and can be either given as an object or called via script.

How to Install

    Download the resource
    Paste the contents of script.txt in a new script over Main
    Copy the Graphics folder on the root of your project

How to Use
As an item:

    Add the following line to Items PBS (change xxx to the id of the item):

    XXX,EGGHATCHER,Egg Hatcher,Egg Hatchers,8,0,"An Egg Hatcher in which to keep up to 6 eggs until they hatch.",2,0,6

    Then, add itemXXX.png to the Graphics/Icons folder.

The functionality code is already implemented within this script. That includes item usage and egg storage after receiving them

External script call:
Whether calling it from the menu or a random npc, just call the following method:

openHatcher

In case of using this method to use the hatcher, you can use a global switch to make it available to the player.
Just change EGGHATCHER_SWITCH to the id of the switch you want to use.
