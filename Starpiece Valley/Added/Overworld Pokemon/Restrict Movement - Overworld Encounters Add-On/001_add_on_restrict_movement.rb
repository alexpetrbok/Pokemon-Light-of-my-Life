# Add-On: the spawned pokemon will not leave there terrain/ grass * by derFischae
#===============================================================================

# This is an add-on for the visible overworld wild encounter script.
# It restricts the movement of spawned pokemon to there spawning terrain.
# I.e. grass encounters stay on grass and will move around grass field but not come out of the grass.
# The same holds for all other terrains, such as sand, mud, or whatever else you added to your project.
# NOTE THAT pokemon will be trapped on isolated tiles (for instance a single grass tile). So please make sure that your maps do not contain such traps.


# FEATURES INCLUDED:
#  - Overworld spawned Grass/Water/Sand/etc encounters move only on Grass/Water/Sand tiles and not leave there terrain.
#  - You can activate the restriction and deactivate it by setting the parameter RESTRICT_MOVEMENT in the settings section below.

# INSTALLATION:
# 1) Place the folder in your plugins folder
# 2) Open the file 001_add_on_restrict_movement.rb and change the the parameters to your liking in the settings section.
