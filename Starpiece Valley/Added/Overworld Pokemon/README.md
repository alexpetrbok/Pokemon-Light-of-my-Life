# Visible-Overworld-Wild-Encounters

* Visible Overworld Wild Encounters Version 20.0.0.4 for PEv20 - by derFischae (Credits if used please)

This script is for Pok√©mon Essentials v20 and v20.1 (for short PEv20). UPDATED TO VERSION 20.0.0.2 FOR PEv20.

As in Pokemon Let's go Pikachu/Eevee or Pokemon Shild and Sword wild encounters pop up on the overworld, they move around and you can start the battle with them simply by moving to the pokemon. Clearly, you also can omit the battle by circling around them.


### FEATURES
- Easy Install as Plugin
- see the pokemon on the overworld before going into battle
- no forced battling against overworld encounters
- Supports individual sprites for shiny, female and alternative forms
- plays the pokemon cry while spawning
- Overworld pokemon will despawn after some steps
- you can have instant wild battle and overworld spawning at the same time and set the propability of that in percentage
- In caves, pokemon don't spawn on impassable Rock-Tiles, which have the Tile-ID 4 
- In water, pokemon won't spawn above other tiles, which made them stuck or walk on ground
- See "advanced features" and "additional features by add-ons" below for more (e.g. additional animations...)

### INSTALLATION
Installation as simple as it can be.
1. Add Graphics: Either get the resources from Gen 8 Project https://reliccastle.com/resources/670/
  and install the "Graphics/Characters" folder in your game file system.
  Or you place your own sprites for your pokemon/fakemon with the right names in your "\Graphics\Characters\Follower" folder and your shiny sprites in your "\Graphics\Characters\Follower shiny" folder. 
  The right name of sprites is:
    usual form     - SPECIES.png   where SPECIES is the species name in capslock (e.g. PIDGEY.png)
    alternate form - SPECIES_n.png where n is the number of the form (e.g. PIKACHU_3.png)
    female form    - SPECIES_female.png or SPECIES_n_female (e.g. PIDGEY_female.png or PIKACHU_3_female.png)
2. Add Script: Follow this link https://github.com/VisibleOverworldWildEncounters/V20 and copy the folder "Visible Overworld Wild Encounters - Script" to your "/plugins/" folder.
3. Change Settings: Open the script file in the folder and change the parameters in the settings section therein as you like. Details descriptions about the parameters can be found there as well. 
4. Install Add-Ons (the other folders): There are a lot of Add-Ons and parameter settings for your personal optimal solution. So, Copy Add-Ons in your "/plugins/" folder and edit parameters in settings of that Add-Ons to your liking. Some Add-On and parameter combinations can produce lag, e.g. a high spawning rate without a spawning cap, or e.g. "NO_OF_CHOSEN_TILES=0" (or too high) when having other scripts like Pokemon Following.
5. Enjoy!
